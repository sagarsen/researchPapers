In a previous paper, we showed that ....

Therefore, any program written for the effective meta-model
will also accept models of the large meta-model.


In the future, we would like to integrate the meta-model
pruning algorithm to dynamically generate an effective
meta-model in MDE tool chains such as editors and
transformations. There is also scope for adding more options to
control the generation of an effective meta-model for various
objectives.




Tool chain : different transformations (T1: Reverse engineering
+ T2: Refactorings)

Refactorings are written in a subset of UML could be applied on
any models that represent a program, UML models or Java program
models.

The static analysis has to be automated
