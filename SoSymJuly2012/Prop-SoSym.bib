  abstract = {Abstract The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto language
	used in the industry for software specifications. Once an application
	has been specified, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) techniques can
	be applied to generate code from such specifications. Since implementing
	a system based on a faulty design requires additional cost and effort,
	it is important to analyse the UML models at earlier stages of the
	software development lifecycle. This paper focuses on utilizing MDA
	techniques to deal with the analysis of UML models and identify design
	faults within a specification. Specifically, we show how UML models
	can be automatically transformed into Alloy which, in turn, can be
	automatically analysed by the Alloy Analyzer. The proposed approach
	relies on MDA techniques to transform UML models to Alloy. This paper
	reports on the challenges of the model transformation from UML class
	diagrams and OCL to Alloy. Those issues are caused by fundamental
	differences in the design philosophy of UML and Alloy. To facilitate
	better the representation of Alloy concepts in the UML, the paper
	draws on the lessons learnt and presents a UML profile for Alloy.},

  title = {Barriers to Systematic Model Transformation Testing},
  journal = {Communications of the ACM},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques support extensive use of
	models in order to manage the increasing complexity of software systems.
	Appropriate abstractions of software system elements can ease reasoning
	and understanding and thus limit the risk of errors in large systems.
	Automatic model transformations play a critical role in MDE since
	they automate complex, tedious, error-prone, and recurrent software
	development tasks. A fault in a transformation can introduce a fault
	in the transformed model, which if undetected and not removed, can
	propagate to other models in successive development steps. As a fault
	propagates further, it becomes more difficult to detect and isolate.
	Since model transformations are meant to be reused, faults present
	in them may result in many faulty models. Model transformations constitute
	a class of programs with unique characteristics that make testing
	them challenging. The complexity of input and output data, lack of
	model management tools, and the heterogeneity of transformation languages
	pose special problems to testers of transformations. In this paper
	we identify current model transformation characteristics that contribute
	to the difficulty of systematically testing transformations. We present
	promising solutions and propose possible ways to overcome these barriers.

  abstract = {Many modeling languages share some common concepts and principles.
	For example, Java, MOF, and UML share some aspects of the concepts
	of classes, methods, attributes, and inheritance. However, model
	transformations such as refactorings specified for a given language
	cannot be readily reused for another language because their related
	metamodels may be structurally different. Our aim is to enable a
	flexible reuse of model transformations across various metamodels.
	Thus, in this paper, we present an approach allowing the specification
	of generic model transformations, in particular refactorings, so
	that they can be applied to different metamodels. Our approach relies
	on two mechanisms: (1) an adaptation based mainly on the weaving
	of aspects; (2) the notion of model typing, an extension of object
	typing in the model-oriented context. We validated our approach by
	performing some experiments that consisted of specifying three well
	known refactorings ( Encapsulate Field,Move Method, and Pull Up Method)
	and applying each of them onto three different metamodels (Java,
	MOF, and UML).},

	in the model-driven engineering community. However, these meta-languages
	focus on structural specifications and have no built-in support for

	the idea of using aspect-oriented modeling to add precise action
	specifications with static type checking and genericity at the meta
	level, and examine related issues and possible solutions. We believe
	that such a combination would bring significant benefits to the community,

	The methodology is based on meta-modeling and graph rewriting. The
	plant is modeled in a domain-specific formalism called the real world
	visual model (RWVM). Such a model is successively transformed to
	an idealized physical model (IPM), to an acausal bond graph (ABG),
	and finally to a causal bond graph (CBG). A Modelica (www.modelica.org)
	model, consisting of a causal (algebraic and differential equation)
	block diagram (CBD), is generated from the CBG. All transformations
	are explicitly modeled using graph grammars. A PID controller model,
	specified in Modelica as a CBD is subsequently integrated with the
	plant model. AToM3 (atom3.cs.mcgill.ca), A tool for multi-formalism
	and meta modeling is used to meta-model and synthesize visual modeling
	environments for the RWVM, IPM, ABG, and CBG formalisms as well as
	for transformations between them. The entire process of modeling,
	transformation, and simulation is demonstrated by means of a hoisting
	device example. Our methodology drastically reduces development time
	(of the modeling tool an indirectly of the domain-specific models),
	integrates model checking via bond graph causal analysis, and facilitates
	management and reuse of meta-knowledge by explicitly modeling formalisms
	and transformations},

	classes, model-driven development uses models, as graphs of interconnected
	objects, described by metamodels. A number of new languages have
	been and continue to be developed for this modelbased paradigm, both
	for model transformation and for general programming using models.
	Many of these use single-object approaches to typing, derived from
	solutions found in object-oriented systems, while others use metamodels
	asmodel types, but without a clear notion of polymorphism. Both of
	these approaches lead to brittle and overly restrictive reuse characteristics.
	In this paper we propose a simple extension to object-oriented typing
	to better cater for a model-oriented context, including a simple
	strategy for typing models as a collection of interconnected objects.
	We suggest extensions to existing type system formalisms to support
	these concepts and theirmanipulation. Using a simple examplewe show

  abstract = {Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both
	to practitioners and to theoreticians, but only recently have generic
	programming techniques become a specific focus of research in the
	functional and object-oriented programming language communities.
	The IFIP TC2 Working Conference on Generic Programming, held at Schloss
	Dagstuhl, Germany, on 11th and 12th July 2002, brought together leading
	researchers in generic programming from around the world, and featured
	papers capturing the state of the art in this important emerging
	area. The conference was sponsored by IFIP Technical Committee 2,
	and organized in cooperation with Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic
	Languages and Calculi. This book contains revised versions of the
	papers that were presented at the conference. <p> <a href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/jeremy.gibbons/publications/wcgp.jpg">
